      <p>
        This Privacy Policy explains how FreshFront ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, shares,
        and protects personal information when you use our websites, applications, and
        services (the "Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the practices described
        in this Policy.

      </p>

      <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p>
        Your information may be stored and processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we use appropriate
        safeguards (e.g., Standard Contractual Clauses) for cross-border transfers.

        verify your identity to process requests. You also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority.
