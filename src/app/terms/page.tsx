      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> {lastUpdated}</p>

      <p>
        These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access to and use of the
        FreshFront platform and related websites, applications, and services (collectively,
        the "Service"). By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you
        agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Service on behalf of a
        business or other legal entity, you represent that you have authority to bind
        that entity, and "you" refers to that entity.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        FreshFront enables business owners to create online stores, publish public store
        pages via shareable links, and collect payments from customers. The Service
        includes authentication for users and integrates with Stripe Connect to enable
        payments and payouts to participating business owners ("Sellers").
      </p>

      <h2>2. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 18 years old and able to form a binding contract.</li>
        <li>You must provide accurate, complete registration information and keep it current.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your credentials and for all activity under your account.</li>
        <li>We may suspend or terminate accounts for violation of these Terms or suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Sellers and Stripe Connect</h2>
      <p>
        Sellers must connect a valid Stripe account to accept payments. Payment processing
        services are provided by Stripe and are subject to the <a href="https://stripe.com/connect-account/legal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Stripe Connected Account Agreement</a>
        and the <a href="https://stripe.com/legal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Stripe Services Agreement</a> (collectively, the "Stripe Terms"). By becoming a Seller and enabling payments, you agree to be bound by the Stripe Terms.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>FreshFront is not a bank, money transmitter, or payment processor; Stripe processes payments and payouts.</li>
        <li>Sellers are responsible for all fees charged by Stripe and any platform fees disclosed within the Service.</li>
        <li>Sellers authorize us and Stripe to share data necessary to provide payments and fraud prevention.</li>
        <li>Sellers must complete any required KYC/KYB verification and comply with Stripe’s prohibited and restricted activities.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Products, Pricing, Taxes, and Shipping</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Sellers are solely responsible for listing products/services accurately, setting prices, and fulfilling orders.</li>
        <li>Sellers are responsible for assessing, collecting, and remitting any applicable taxes and complying with tax laws.</li>
        <li>Sellers are responsible for shipping, delivery terms, and any customer service obligations.</li>
        <li>Prohibited content: illegal goods, regulated items without authorization, dangerous materials, intellectual property violations, or any content prohibited by applicable law or Stripe.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Customer Purchases and Refunds</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Customers purchase directly from Sellers. FreshFront provides the platform but is not the seller of record.</li>
        <li>Refunds and returns are handled by Sellers under their posted policies and applicable law. Where supported, Stripe may facilitate refunds via the Seller’s Stripe account.</li>
        <li>Chargebacks and disputes are the responsibility of Sellers; amounts may be debited from Seller balances.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Acceptable Use</h2>

      </ul>

        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE WILL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF (A) THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO US (IF ANY) IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM OR (B) $100.
      </p>
